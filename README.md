**An introduction to GLSL shaders and graphics programming that runs in your web browser.**

## Running this thing

First, you need to [get a browser with WebGL](http://get.webgl.org/), as well
as a copy of [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and [git](http://git-scm.com/). Once you have
all of that set up, you can install the workshop using [npm](http://npmjs.org/), which
is included with node:

```
npm install -g shader-school
```

After that completes, you should be able to run the workshopper with the command:

```
shader-school
```

The script will ask you if you want to create an answer directory, press `y` to
accept. This will populate your current directory with shader files for you to
edit for each lesson â€“ hopefully, it should also automatically open your web
browser but if it doesn't you can find the workshop menu on
[http://localhost:12492/](http://localhost:12492/).

## Stuck?

Feedback and criticism is welcome, please log your troubles in
[issues](https://github.com/gl-modules/shader-school/issues). The workshop is
still being worked on but is very close to being complete!

Full curriculum reviews
[like this one](https://github.com/timoxley/functional-javascript-workshop/issues/7)
are very helpful. More feedback like this please!
