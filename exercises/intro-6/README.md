# Matrices

## Exercise

Write a function to raise a 2x2 matrix `m` to the nth power, where 0 <= n < 16 is an integer. To get started, edit the template <a href="/open/intro-6" target="_blank">file `mpow.glsl` in the directory for this project</a>.

Besides vectors, GLSL has special datatypes for representing low dimensional matrices. There are only 3 of these:  `mat2, mat3, mat4` which correspond to a 2x2, 3x3 and 4x4 square matrix respectively:

```glsl
//Create a a 2x2 identity matrix.  Note matrix
//constructors are in column major order.
mat2 I = mat2(1.0, 0.0,
              0.0, 1.0);

//Equivalently,
mat2 I = mat2(1.0);

//Matrices can also be constructed by
//giving columns:
vec3 a = vec3(0, 1, 0);
vec3 b = vec3(2, 0, 0);
vec3 c = vec3(0, 0, 4);
mat3 J = mat3(a, b, c);

//Now:
//J = mat3(0, 2, 0,
//         1, 0, 0,
//         0, 0, 4);
```

The columns of matrices can be accessed using the square brackets.  For example:

```glsl
mat3 m = mat3(1.1, 2.1, 3.1,
              1.2, 2.2, 3.2,
              1.3, 2.3, 3.3);

//Read out first column of m
vec3 a = m[0];

//Now: a = vec3(1.1, 2.1, 3.1);
```

### Arithmetic

Matrices support similar arithmetic operations to vectors.  Both scalar addition and vector addition are defined:

```glsl
mat2 m = mat2(1, 2,
              3, 4);
mat2 w = mat2(7, 8,
              9, 10);

//Component wise addition
mat2 h = m + w;

//Now: h = mat2(8,  10,
//              12, 14)

//Scalar multiplication
mat2 j = 2.0 * m;
//Now: j = mat2(2, 4,
//              6, 8)
```

The multiplication or `*` operator for matrices does not have the same meaning as for vectors.  Instead of being applied component-wise, it is used to implement matrix multiplication in the linear algebra sense. If you want to do component-wise multiplication, you can use the `matrixCompMult` function:

```glsl
mat2 m = mat2(1, 2,
              3, 4);
mat2 w = mat2(7, 8,
              9, 10);

mat2 q = matrixCompMult(m, w);

//q = mat2( 7, 16,
//         27, 40)
```

Instead, the `*` operator has the effect of multiplying matrices and transforming vectors:

```glsl
mat2 m = mat2(1, 2,
              3, 4);

vec2 v = m * vec2(1, 2);  //v = vec2(5, 8)

//In GLSL, switching order of arguments is equivalent
//to transposing:
vec2 u = vec2(1, 2) * m;  //u = vec2(7, 10)
```
